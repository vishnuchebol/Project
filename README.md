# Project
This project was made according to the Task provided. I tried doing the state to country conversion but due to everyday evals and hectic schedule, i couldnt finish it. I tried fetching from the API provided but didnt know how to map each state to its country. I tried adding new functionalities but did not have the time to finish it. It was a nice learning experiance where in i learnt a lot about JS, HTML and CSS and im excited to explore more about it.
